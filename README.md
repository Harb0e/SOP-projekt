# Introduction to project
This project is created as a part of an interdisciplinary high school assignment, combining two subjects to explore a specific topic in depth.
The focus is on neural networks, a fascinating area within artificial intelligence and machine learning inspired by how the human brain processes information.
By combining mathematics, such as linear algebra and calculus, with programming, the project demonstrates how theoretical concepts and practical applications
can be used together to design and train neural networks capable of solving complex problems.

## How the netværk was build
The neural network in this project is built from scratch using NumPy, a Python library essential for
handling linear algebra operations. NumPy provides the tools to implement core mathematical
concepts, such as matrix multiplications and activation functions, which are the backbone of the network.
While the main architecture and training process rely on custom implementations, other libraries are
used solely for data preprocessing, such as normalizing input data or splitting datasets. This ensures
that the focus remains on understanding and constructing the network itself, rather than relying on
pre-built machine learning frameworks.

## Report
As part of this project, I have written a detailed report that explains the mathematics underlying the
neural network, including concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, and optimization. The report also
covers programming theory, focusing on how the network was implemented from scratch, and
includes an evaluation of the network’s performance and potential areas for improvement.
The report is written in danish.
